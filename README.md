# A React App that uses ffmpeg.wasm to transcode video to audio and gif

## Getting started

- Ensure you are running a [compatabile browser](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/)
- ffmpeg.wasm needs the "Shared Array Buffer" capability. You may need to enable it in your browser.
  - If you're on a mac, you can try the following on Google Chrome `open -a "Google Chrome" --args --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer`
  - See more about this on the [ffmpeg.wasm Github page](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)

Now you can run the following commands:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`
